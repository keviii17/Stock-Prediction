This project is a menu-driven stock market prediction system that utilizes machine learning to forecast stock prices for multiple companies. It leverages Yahoo Finance to fetch historical stock data and applies Random Forest Regression for predictions.  

## Features:  
✅ Fetches real-time stock data from **Yahoo Finance** 📈  
✅ Predicts stock prices using machine learning algorithms 🧠  
✅ Supports multiple companies **(Apple, Google, Microsoft, Tesla)** 🏢  
✅ Visualizes actual vs. predicted stock prices with **Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and accuracy (%)** displayed 📊  
✅ User-friendly menu-driven interface for easy navigation 🎯  

## Technologies Used:  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Yahoo Finance API** for real-time stock data  
- **Scikit-Learn** for machine learning (Random Forest Regression)  
- **Matplotlib** for data visualization  
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation
